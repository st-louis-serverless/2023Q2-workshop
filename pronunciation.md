## Pronouncing the strange words in the Land of Kubernetes

I was watching a training video on Kubernetes and the instructor kept mispronouncing the work _Kubernetes_. Or maybe
I had always mispronounced it? Off to the internet I went to find the truth about how to pronounce these strange
words:
- Kubernetes
- kubectl (the Kubernetes cli)
- etcd
- kubelet
- k8s

Here's what I found online:

- Kubernetes: The consensus is `coo-ber-net-ees`.
- kubectl: There's less consensus about this one. The most common seems to be `coob-control` but common variations
  include `koob-c-t-l`, `cube-c-t-l`, `cube-cuttle` and `coob-cuttle`.
- etcd: The consensus is `etsy-d`
- kubelet: The consensus seems to be `coob-let`, but some say `cube-let`
- k8s: Many people like to pronounce it as the full name, i.e. `coo-ber-net-ees`. Many others leverage the shortening
  to shorten the pronunciation to `kates` or `k-eights`. When I read it, my mind says `coo-ber-net-ees`, but when I
  write it, my mind says `kates`

### Here's what I'll probably say in this workshop:
- Kubernetes: `coo-ber-net-ees`
- kubectl: `coob-control` or `koob-c-t-l` or `cube-c-t-l`
- etcd: `etsy-d`
- kubelet: `coob-let`
- k8s: `kates` or `coo-ber-net-ees`
