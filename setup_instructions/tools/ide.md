## Integrated Development Environment

I suppose hardcore text editor aficionados won't need an IDE. That's not me though.

I'll be using JetBrains tools (IDEA). You may prefer Visual Studio Code (VSCode) 
or something else.

Whatever your choice, before the workshop look for and install any plugins / extensions 
you'd like. As always, _caveat emptor_ so I recommend choosing the most popular and 
well-supported extensions.
