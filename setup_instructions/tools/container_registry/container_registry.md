# Container Registry

The term `Container Registry` is a bit of a misnomer as we don't actually register containers. 
What we actually register are the built container _images_. Unfortunately, the time to change 
the name has long passed, so you'll hear me say both `image registry` and `container registry`.

In this workshop, we'll default to using the GitHub registry as it's more likely the one organizations 
using GitHub would use.
