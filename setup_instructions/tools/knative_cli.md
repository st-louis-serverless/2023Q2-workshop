# Knative CLI

The Knative cli gives us a way to interact with Knative from the commandline
without having to deploy YAML config files to our Kubernetes cluster.

> Note 1: The Knative CLI is great for development and CI (Continuous Integration), 
but for deployments into Kubernetes clusters running in the cloud or your data center, 

> Note 2: There are two ways to create and run a knative function. The first is a very 
developer friendly way, using the func cli. The second is using the Knative 
function cli. Since we'll need the Knative cli anyway, we'll just install the
Knative CLI and the func plugin.
