# Serverless on Kubernetes Workshop Setup

This will be a fast-paced workshop, so you will need to complete the following steps 
before the start of the workshop. Details on each of the steps is included below.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to have a machine that has `docker` on it, though not necessarily Docker Desktop. Some alternatives:
  - Rancher Desktop (This is my favorite alternative.)
  - PodMan (I've always had problems with this in one way or another.)
  
- If you are a Windows user, you'll need the ability to execute the commands I present that just work 
  for Mac OSX and Linux
  - If you see `~/someDir`, I'm just referring to `someDir` in your user home  
  - Maybe WSL or a Linux VM will serve you well.
  - That said, I think all the command line tools have Windows executables. Check the online docs for the tools


## Tool Setup
In this workshop we'll use a variety of tools beyond your chosen IDE. Follow the instructions in the 
[Tool Setup](tool_setup.md) docs to install these before the workshop.
